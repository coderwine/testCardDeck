# Reason for this Build
**deckSample.js** is meant to take three different suits in a deck, shuffle each, and toggle between each one through one session. Users should be able to select a deck to choose from and reveal a new card throughout each "turn".

## The Process
Users will need to:
- Select from a deck of their choosing.
  - Display the revealed card and have it held in a discard pile.
    - May want to include an option to return card to deck
  - This will reduce the amount of cards remaining in the original deck.
